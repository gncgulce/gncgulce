  <h2>Hi, I'm G&uuml;lce,</h2>
  <p>Welcome to my little project blog, where I document some stuff I do to improve my skills in the field of data science.<br><br>
    About myself: I was born and raised in Turkey, where I graduated in Econometrics and I really found it fantastic to work
    with data, applying some maths and draw conclusions out of it. But after university I worked in the fields of Sales and Accounting for 
    different automotive companies, where it just wasnâ€™t part of my job to apply the stuff I was interested in during my studies.<br><br> 
    Until now, basically all my work experiences were generally focused on communication with people. Of course, all of them have 
    brought a lot of benefits to my personality and career. With these benefits, I had the opportunity to experience different languages, 
    cultures and living standards by going from Turkey to Ireland and to Germany.<br><br>
    I have the feeling that I want to do something new, that fits my interests and skills, which I learned during my education life 
    and my work experience. That's why the field of Data Science is of great interest to me. So I started to search about the topic. 
    While thinking about how I can adapt my competencies to the field of data science with the inspiration of perspectives, I asked 
    myself the question 'How can I get into this field and do it professionally?'.
    I realized, I should support my development process by learning some of the Programming Languages and doing small projects.<br><br>
    Thus, I am happy to advance my process by applying my communication, analysis, interpretation, research, statistics and 
    mathematics knowledge on these projects and to share these studies with those who are interested.
    So that's the background of this little blog here. If you're interested, feel free to take a look into my projects below.<br><br>
